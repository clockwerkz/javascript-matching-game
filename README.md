# javascript-matching-game
This isCoursera.org's html/css/javascript class week 3 assignment, a javascript matching game where the player must locate the extra happy face on the screen.

More Project details: 
The project is to create a matching game.  There are two sides to the screen with happy faces spawning in identical locations except for one additional happy face spawn on the left.  The objective of the game is to locate the extra happy face.  After each successful attempt, the board clears and respawns the happy face pairs (with the additional extra happy face), but the number of pairings increase.  The game continues adding more and more pairs until the player makes an incorrect guess and ends the game.
